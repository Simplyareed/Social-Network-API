## Social Network API

## Description
The Social Network API is designed for a social media startup to manage large amounts of unstructured data using a NoSQL database. The project provides a robust backend system that allows the creation, update, and deletion of users and their thoughts, as well as managing reactions and friendships.

Motivation: To create a scalable and efficient backend for social networks that can handle large and dynamic datasets.

Why: The project was built to provide a reliable API for social media platforms, ensuring high performance and scalability with a NoSQL database.

Problem Solved: It addresses the need for managing unstructured data efficiently and provides a structured way to handle user interactions, thoughts, reactions, and friendships.

What I Learned: Implementation of Mongoose with MongoDB, building RESTful APIs, handling complex data relationships, and working with NoSQL databases.
